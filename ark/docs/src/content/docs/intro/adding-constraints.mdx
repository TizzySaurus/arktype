TypeScript is extremely versatile for representing types like `string` or `number`, but what about `email` or `positive integer less than 100`?

In ArkType, conditions that narrow a type beyond its **basis** are called **constraints**.

Constraints are a first-class citizen of ArkType and behave according to the same principles of set-theory that govern TypeScript. In other words, **they just work**.

## Syntax

```ts
import { type } from "arktype"
// ---cut---
const contact = type({
	// many common
	email: "email",
	score: "1 <= integer < 100"
})
```
